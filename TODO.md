# TODO
* [v] handle error stream from grep
    * [x] show errors from one server, not all
* [x] show total record count when that option is passed
* [ ] show error when no cmd line args are given
* [ ] client should exit with error if it can't connect to any servers
* [v] pass command line args individually (so user provided spaces are maintained)
* [ ] unit/integration testing
* [ ] log files from testing
* [ ] reading IPs from file
* [ ] shell script to kick off servers + smaller client cmd
