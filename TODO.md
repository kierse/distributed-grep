# TODO
* [ ] handle error stream from grep
    * [ ] show errors from one server, not all
* [ ] show total record count when that option is passed
* [ ] show error when no cmd line args are given
* [ ] client should exit with error if it can't connect to any servers
* [x] pass command line args individually (so user provided spaces are maintained)
